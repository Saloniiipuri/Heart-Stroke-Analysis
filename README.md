# Heart Disease Data Analysis

This project analyzes clinical data to explore patterns and indicators that may contribute to the risk of **heart disease**. 
The analysis is performed using Python in a Google Colab notebook.

## What I Did-

- Loaded and cleaned the dataset
- Explored relationships between heart disease and other health features
- Visualized data trends using graphs like bar plots, box plots, histograms, etc.
- Focused on variables such as age, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, and more
